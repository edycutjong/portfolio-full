# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration

## When to Use

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Two-stage review after each task: spec compliance first, then code quality
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

## The Process

1. **Read plan** - Extract all tasks with full text, note context, create TodoWrite
2. **For each task:**
   - Dispatch implementer subagent
   - If questions: Answer clearly before proceeding
   - Implementer implements, tests, commits, self-reviews
   - Dispatch spec reviewer → confirm code matches spec
   - If issues: implementer fixes → re-review
   - Dispatch code quality reviewer → check implementation quality
   - If issues: implementer fixes → re-review
   - Mark task complete
3. **After all tasks** - Dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation
4. **Complete** - Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch

## Advantages

**vs. Manual execution:**
- Subagents follow TDD naturally
- Fresh context per task (no confusion)
- Parallel-safe (subagents don't interfere)
- Subagent can ask questions

**Quality gates:**
- Self-review catches issues before handoff
- Two-stage review: spec compliance, then code quality
- Review loops ensure fixes actually work
- Spec compliance prevents over/under-building
- Code quality ensures implementation is well-built

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
- Skip reviews (spec compliance OR code quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context
- Ignore subagent questions
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance
- Skip review loops
- **Start code quality review before spec compliance is ✅**
- Move to next task while either review has open issues

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

**If reviewer finds issues:**
- Implementer (same subagent) fixes them
- Reviewer reviews again
- Repeat until approved
- Don't skip the re-review

**If subagent fails task:**
- Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions
- Don't try to fix manually (context pollution)

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **superpowers:using-git-worktrees** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting
- **superpowers:writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **superpowers:requesting-code-review** - Code review template for reviewer subagents
- **superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

**Subagents should use:**
- **superpowers:test-driven-development** - Subagents follow TDD for each task

**Alternative workflow:**
- **superpowers:executing-plans** - Use for parallel session instead of same-session execution
