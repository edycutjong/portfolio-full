## Overview

DataPulse Analytics is a real-time streaming analytics engine built with Rust for maximum performance and memory safety. It processes millions of events with zero-cost abstractions and provides blazing-fast aggregate computations.

## Key Features

- **Streaming Architecture**: Process events as they arrive with minimal latency
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents data races and memory leaks
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level APIs with no runtime overhead
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Partition-based processing for distributed workloads

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Memory-safe systems programming
- **Axum**: Ergonomic async web framework
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for high-concurrency workloads
- **PostgreSQL**: Durable storage for aggregated metrics

## Performance Benchmarks

- 1M+ events/second ingestion rate
- P99 latency under 10ms for aggregation queries
- Memory footprint under 100MB for typical workloads

## Architecture

The engine uses a multi-stage pipeline:
1. **Ingestion**: Async batch processing with backpressure
2. **Processing**: Stateless transformations with actor model
3. **Aggregation**: Time-windowed computations with efficient storage

## Outcome

DataPulse demonstrates mastery of Rust for high-performance systems, combining safety guarantees with production-grade performance.
