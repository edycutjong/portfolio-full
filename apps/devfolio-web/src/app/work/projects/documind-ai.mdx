## Overview

DocuMind AI enables users to upload documents, ask questions, and receive cited answers. Built with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, it combines the power of LLMs with vector-based semantic search for accurate, contextual responses.

## Key Features

- **Document Processing**: Upload PDFs, Word docs, and text files. Documents are chunked and embedded for efficient retrieval.
- **Semantic Search**: Pinecone vector database stores embeddings for fast similarity search across your document corpus.
- **RAG Architecture**: LangChain orchestrates the retrieval and generation pipeline, ensuring answers are grounded in your documents.
- **Citation Support**: Every answer includes references to the source documents and specific passages.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & FastAPI**: High-performance async API backend
- **LangChain**: RAG orchestration and prompt engineering
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 for generation, Ada for embeddings
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for semantic search
- **Redis**: Caching layer for frequently accessed queries

## Architecture

The system follows a clean separation of concerns:
1. **Ingestion Pipeline**: Documents → Chunking → Embedding → Vector Store
2. **Query Pipeline**: Question → Semantic Search → Context Assembly → LLM Generation → Response

## Outcome

DocuMind AI demonstrates production-ready AI infrastructure, handling complex document corpora while maintaining sub-second query response times.
