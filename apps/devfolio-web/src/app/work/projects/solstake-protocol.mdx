## Overview

SolStake Protocol is a decentralized staking platform built on Solana. Users can stake tokens and earn rewards through an automated on-chain distribution mechanism, all secured by Anchor framework smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Staking Mechanism**: Lock tokens for variable periods with tiered rewards
- **On-Chain Distribution**: Automated reward calculations and distributions
- **Security First**: Anchor framework for type-safe, auditable smart contracts
- **Low Fees**: Leveraging Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Smart contract development
- **Anchor**: Solana development framework
- **Solana**: High-performance blockchain
- **TypeScript**: Frontend and testing SDK

## Smart Contract Architecture

- **Stake Pool**: Manages user deposits and withdrawal requests
- **Reward Distributor**: Calculates and distributes rewards based on stake duration
- **Governance**: Future upgrade path for decentralized parameter updates

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all instruction handlers
- Access control for admin functions
- Reentrancy protection patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Outcome

SolStake demonstrates expertise in blockchain development, combining Rust systems programming with Web3 concepts and secure smart contract design patterns.
