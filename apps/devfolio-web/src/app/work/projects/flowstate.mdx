## Overview

FlowState is a high-performance real-time collaboration engine built for horizontal scaling. It provides sub-millisecond message broadcasting with room-based architecture, making it ideal for collaborative applications like document editors, whiteboards, and multiplayer games.

## Key Features

- **WebSocket Architecture**: Persistent bidirectional connections for instant state updates
- **Room-Based Isolation**: Users can join specific rooms with automatic connection management
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Redis pub/sub enables multiple server instances to communicate
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with state reconciliation

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: High-performance, concurrent backend
- **Gorilla WebSocket**: Production-ready WebSocket implementation
- **Redis**: Pub/sub for cross-instance communication
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

## Performance

Built with Go's goroutines for lightweight concurrency:
- Handles 10,000+ concurrent connections per instance
- Sub-millisecond message latency
- Efficient memory usage via connection pooling

## Outcome

FlowState showcases expertise in building real-time systems with Go, demonstrating understanding of concurrent programming patterns and distributed system design.
